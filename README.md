# knowledge-base

A ever expanding collection of notes, random facts, and strategies for software engineering. Notes are organized roughly following the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) system.

## Setup

This knowledge base is written using markdown with the intent to viewed in any notes app that supports markdown. My personal favorite is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Note taking strategy

Notes are first written on paper using the [QEC Method](/permanent-notes/QEC-Method-of-Note-Taking.md). They are then copied into new notes or existing notes as a final draft.
