# String

Strings are character arrays and share a lot of similarities with [arrays](Array.md) as shown in their relative time complexity.

| Operation | Big-O |
|-----------|-------|
| Access | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) |
| Insert | O(n) |
| Remove | O(n) |

## Common data-structures for looking up strings

- [Prefix Tree](Prefix-tree)
- [Suffix Tree](Suffix-tree)

## Common string algorithms

- [Rabin Karp](Rabin-Karp) for sub-string searching
- [KMP](KMP) for sub-string searching
