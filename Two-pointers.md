# Two pointers

The two pointers technique is a generalization of the [Sliding-window](Sliding-window.md) technique. The primary difference is that the two pointers can cross over one another and could reference different arrays. 

## Common use cases

- Palindromic substrings
- Sorting colors
- Merging sorted arrays
