# PARA Method
How can you organize files in a digital space that is easy to maintain, simple, and flexible?

- PARA has 4 categories at the top level to encompass all subjects
	- Project: Short term projects or tasks that are currently being worked on
	- Area: Long-term responsibilities that need to be worked on or maintained
	- Resource: Ideas that you may want to reference in the future
	- Archive: Anything that is no longer relevant from the other three categories
