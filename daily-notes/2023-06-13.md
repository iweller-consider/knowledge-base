Priori analysis
- study algorithm in detail to determine the time and space consumed by an algorithm
- Language and hardware independant
- Will produce time function and the space function

Posteriori testing
- Is done on programs
- Will know how much time a program is taking and how much memory it is consuming
- hardware, language, OS, and environment specific

Algorithm characteristics
- Takes 0 or more input
- produces at least 1 output
- Must be known to be solvable, cannot be something that has no known solution
- Must terminate at some point
- All steps must be used in the procedure, no unnecessary statements
