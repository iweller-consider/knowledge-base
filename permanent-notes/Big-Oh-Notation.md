# Big Oh Notation

Big Oh Notation *O(g(n))* Serves as a useful abstraction of time-complexity functions. It simplifies the function that models the algorithms time-complexity by removing things like multiplicative constants. Big Oh Notation is the upper bound, or worst case scenario, in the [RAM-Model-of-Computing](RAM-Model-of-Computing.md)

There are just a few function classes that are used in basic algorithm analysis. In order of increasing dominance:
1. [Constant-functions](Constant-functions.md)
2. [Logarithmic-functions](Logarithmic-functions.md)
3. [Linear-functions](Linear-functions.md)
4. [Super-linear-functions](Super-linear-functions.md)
5. [Quadratic-functions](Quadratic-functions.md)
6. [Cubic-functions](Cubic-functions.md)
7. [Exponential-functions](Exponential-functions.md)
8. [Factorial-functions](Factorial-functions.md)
