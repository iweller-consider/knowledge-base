# Lower-Common-Ancestor-of-a-Binary-Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

## Method

Recursively check both sides

## Solution

### go

```go
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
	if root == nil || root == p || root == q {
		return root
	}
	
	left := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
	right := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
	
	if left != nil && right != nil {
		return root
	}
	
	if left != nil {
		return left
	}
	
	return right
}
```
