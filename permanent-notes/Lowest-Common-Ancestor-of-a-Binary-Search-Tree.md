# Lowest-Common-Ancestor-of-a-Binary-Search-Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

## Method

Recursively compare the left and right nodes

## Solution

### go

```go
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
	if p.Val < root.Val && q.Val < root.Val {
		return lowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
	}
	if p.Val > root.Val && q.Val > root.Val {
		return lowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
	}
	return root
}
```
