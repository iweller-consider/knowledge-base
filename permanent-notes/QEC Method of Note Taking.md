# QEC Method of Note Taking

QEC note taking is a method described by Cal Newport in the book "How to Become a Straight-A Student."
QEC stands for **question**, **evidence**, and **conclusion**. This allows for broad subjects to be broken up into smaller components and refined to help understand the more critical details. In addition, this can lead to a better understanding of the big picture that the idea is trying to convey.
